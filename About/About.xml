	<description>Adds new bills to the Stonecutter's table which cuts 3 chunks at a time. *No research required*

Notes:
- Load this mod **AFTER** the mod called "Cupro's Stones" if you have it.
- Cutting 3 chunks at once creates 60 blocks and costs 15% less work than cutting single chunks at a time.
- Should be safe to add and remove to your saved games, just make sure you delete the bulk bills before uninstalling.
